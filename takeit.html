    <p>you heft the sword into your hands.</p>
    <p>despite never having held it before, it is weighted perfectly in your hands.</p>
    <p>you test out the weapon, swinging it at an imaginary foe.</p>
    <p>in the box lay a sheath. it was previously covered by the sword.</p>
    <p>you sheath the sword and attach it to your hip.</p>
    <p>you feel safer already.</p>
