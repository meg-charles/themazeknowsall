    <p>you awake in the grass, your head aching.
      it takes effort to sit up and take in your surroundings.</p>
      <p>youâ€™re in a maze.</p>
      <p>the hedges around you are thick and if you stay silent, you can hear chittering and chirping from between the leaves.</p>
      <p>you stand finally, feeling another ache in your chest.</p>
      <p>what happened to you?</p>
      <br>
      <p>you begin to look around once more.</p>
      <p>in front of you is a sign nestled between the leaves of the hedge.</p>
      <img src="sign.jpg" alt="ominous sign" width="400px">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>well, you shouldn't need anymore encouraging after that!</p>
      <p>there are pathways on the left and right of you. you just have to choose.</p>
