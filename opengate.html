    <p>you step through the gate, bracing for the worst.</p>
    <p>silence pierces the air. nothing stirs in the hedges.</p>
    <p>you suddenly feel that you're in danger</p>
    <p>you go to turn back through the gates when they slam shut.</p>
    <p>a harsh wind sweeps through the clearing.</p>
    <p>you turn to find what watches you, but nothing shows up.</p>
    <p>the ground rumbles beneath your feet and you look to see the hedge
      opening in front of you.</p>
    <p>slowly, you walk towards the opening.</p>
    <p>a voice calls out from above you.</p>
